# NYTimes

Disclaimer: Please only look at the project on a 13 inch Mac Book on Google Chrome with Javascript enabled lol. I had to take a break from the project because of my (very time consuming) summer class so I didn't have a chance to add media queries. 

This current version is with stories I created myself using a custom HTML element. In the future I plan to use the NYTimes API to display their top stories and have an option to further filter through the top stories. Most of the buttoms are non-functional as I do have a lot to build with the site-- unfortunately creating the skeleton of the main page took longer than intended; but check out the story on cats and the books page which displays the NYTimes bestsellers list using their API!
