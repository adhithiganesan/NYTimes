# NYTimes

Link to site: https://adhithiganesan.github.io/NYTimes/html/index.html

Check out the books page which uses the NYTimes API to display the NYTimes bestsellers list! 

My current implementation of the site includes fun stories I created myself. In the future, I plan to integrate the NYTimes API into more aspects of the site so it displayes real time information fetched from the NYTimes.
