# NYTimes

A little side project I'm working on for fun where I try to recreate the NYTimes website 



Current version:
- writing fun little stories myself to display on the site as I explore with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Future Plans:
- use NYTimes APIs to display actual stories from the site
- set up back-end to store data and implement server-side functionalities
